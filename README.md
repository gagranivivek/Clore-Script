Ok, this is a quick guide on how to setup Clore and use my script to install the Nimble miner.

First, I would appreciate it if you used my Clore referral code, it helps fund my machines I use for testing my scripts - https://clore.ai?ref_id=jzj1ckbf

Once you have signed up, the simplest way to look for an instance is to click on "Marketplace" and set the filters to the following -

You will then get a list of instances like this -

Work out the cost per hour using the current Clore price x amount of Clore per day rental fee / 24. Currently a 4090 is around $0.122-$0.13 per hour.

Click on "Rent" and then you will be taken to this screen -

Select the "PyTorch" image. then scroll down and click "Create" -

You will then see your machine you rented under "My Orders". It will display a status of "Deploying". This will change to "Deployed" once it is ready to connect to. This can take some time, so you will need to be patient.

Once the machine status says "Deployed" click here -

This will open a screen looking like this - 
<img width="497" alt="image" src="https://github.com/neo250376/Clore-Script/assets/36828226/69fe7d90-6292-41d9-a3d1-2223787c825e">

Click "Jupyter Lab" then click "Terminal" -

A screen will open that is your command prompt. Copy and paste the lines from my script one by one (don't copy and paste the lines with the # at the beginning).
